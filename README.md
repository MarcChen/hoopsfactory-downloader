set HOOPSFACTORY_USERNAME=your_username
set HOOPSFACTORY_PASSWORD=your_password
set DOWNLOAD_PATH=C:\Downloads\HoopsFactory
```

#### Method 3: PowerShell (Session only)

```

## Usage

### Manual Execution
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

### Automated Execution with Windows Task Scheduler

#### Step 1: Create a Batch File
Create a file named `run_downloader.bat` in your project directory:

```batch
@echo off
cd /d "C:\path\to\your\download_hoopsfactory"
poetry run python main.py
pause
```

Or if Poetry is not in your system PATH, use the full path:

```batch
@echo off
cd /d "C:\path\to\your\download_hoopsfactory"
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts\poetry.exe" run python main.py
pause
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Task Scheduler
1. Open Task Scheduler (search "Task Scheduler" in Start menu)
2. Click "Create Basic Task" in the right panel
3. **Name**: Enter "HoopsFactory Downloader"
4. **Description**: "Automatically downloads files from HoopsFactory"
5. **Trigger**: Choose your preferred schedule:
   - Daily: Runs every day at specified time
   - Weekly: Runs on specific days of the week
   - Monthly: Runs on specific days of the month
6. **Action**: Select "Start a program"
7. **Program/script**: Browse to your `run_downloader.bat` file
8. **Start in**: Enter the directory path: `C:\path\to\your\download_hoopsfactory`

#### Step 3: Advanced Settings (Optional)
1. After creating the task, right-click it and select "Properties"
2. **General tab**:
   - Check "Run whether user is logged on or not" (requires password)
   - Check "Run with highest privileges" if needed
3. **Conditions tab**:
   - Uncheck "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power" for laptops
   - Check "Wake the computer to run this task" if needed
4. **Settings tab**:
   - Check "Allow task to be run on demand"
   - Set appropriate timeout and retry settings

#### Step 4: Set Environment Variables for Task
If the task doesn't pick up your user environment variables:

1. Edit your `run_downloader.bat` file to include the environment variables:
```batch
@echo off
set HOOPSFACTORY_URL=https://example.hoopsfactory.com
set HOOPSFACTORY_USERNAME=your_username
set HOOPSFACTORY_PASSWORD=your_password
set DOWNLOAD_PATH=C:\Downloads\HoopsFactory

cd /d "C:\path\to\your\download_hoopsfactory"
poetry run python main.py
pause
```

Or with full Poetry path:
```batch
@echo off
set HOOPSFACTORY_URL=https://example.hoopsfactory.com
set HOOPSFACTORY_USERNAME=your_username
set HOOPSFACTORY_PASSWORD=your_password
set DOWNLOAD_PATH=C:\Downloads\HoopsFactory

cd /d "C:\path\to\your\download_hoopsfactory"
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts\poetry.exe" run python main.py
pause
```

### Alternative: Using Poetry Script Directly in Task Scheduler
Instead of using a batch file, you can run the Poetry script directly:

1. **Program/script**: `poetry` or full path to Poetry executable
2. **Arguments**: `run hoopsfactory-downloader`
3. **Start in**: Your project directory path

## Logging

The script creates log files to track execution:
- Check the console output for real-time status
- Log files are saved in the project directory (if logging is implemented)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python not found**: Ensure Python is installed and added to system PATH
2. **Module not found**: Install required packages with `poetry install`
3. **Permission denied**: Run as administrator or check file permissions
4. **Task doesn't run**: Verify environment variables and file paths in Task Scheduler
5. **Authentication fails**: Double-check username and password in environment variables

### Testing Your Setup

1. Test environment variables:
```cmd
echo %HOOPSFACTORY_URL%
echo %HOOPSFACTORY_USERNAME%
```

2. Test script execution:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

3. Test batch file (if using):
```cmd
run_downloader.bat
```
